  // what your forecast is built from, how you set the national environment,
  // and how you handled uncertainty. Until you fill this in, your site shows a
  // reminder in this spot.
  //
  // For example, the class model could be described like this (describe your
  // own model):
  //   "A fundamentals-only model (no polls). Each race's predicted Democratic share combines the district's partisan lean, incumbency, and a forecast of the national House vote from presidential approval, gas prices, income and the midterm penalty.",
  //   "Uncertainty combines one national error shared by every race with a separate error for each race. Seat totals come from 10,000 simulated elections.",
